#  LFD creates a linear differential operator object of the form
#
#  Lx(t) = b_0(t) x(t) +  + b_{m-1}(t) D^{m-1}x(t) + D^m x(t)
#  or
#  Lx(t) = b_0(t) x(t) +  + b_{m-1}(t) D^{m-1}x(t) + D^m x(t)
#          \exp[b_m(t) D^m x(t).
#
#  Function x(t) is operated on by this operator L, and the operator
#  computes a linear combination of the function and its first m
#  derivatives.   The function x(t) must be scalar.
#  The operator L is called the HOMOGENEOUS because it does
#  not involve input or forcing functions.
#
#  The linear combination of derivatives is defined by the weight
#  or coefficient functions b_j(t), and these are assumed to vary
#  over t, although of course they may also be constant as a
#  special case.  Each of these must be scalar function.
#
#  The weight coefficient for D^m is special in that it must
#  be positive to properly identify the operator.  This is why
#  it is exponentiated.  In most situations, it will be 0,
#  implying a weight of one, and this is the default.
#
#  Some important functions also have the capability of allowing
#  the argument that is an LFD object be an integer. They convert
#  the integer internally to an LFD object by INT2LFD().  These are:
#     EVAL.FD()
#     EVAL.MON()
#     EVAL.POS()
#     EVAL.BASIS()
#     EVAL.PENALTY()
#
#  Arguments:
#
#  NDERIV  the order of the operator, that is,
#          the highest order of derivative.  This corresponds
#          to m in the above equation.
#  BWTLIST  A list object of length either NDERIV or NDERIV + 1.
#          Each list contains an FD object, an FDPAR object or
#          a numerical scalar constant.
#          If there are NDERIV functions, then the coefficient of D^m
#          is set to 1 otherwise, function NDERIV+1 contains a function
#          that is exponentiated to define the actual coefficient.
#          bwtlist may also be a vector of length NDERIV or NDERIVE + 1
#          containing constants.  If this is the case, the constants
#          are used as coefficients for a constant basis function.
#          The default is a row vector of NDERIV zeros.
#
#  Returns:
#
#  LFDOBJ  a functional data object
